Hey! If you're reading this, then you've found the public side of the new v0.2
documentation beta. This isn't fully baked yet, and not production ready.

I do most of the documentation work locally; I'm just using this as a test
deploy target so I can see what the docs look like on the web, as well as
working out any issues to do with the GitHub Actions side of the process.

You can use these resources if you want, but I'm not making any guarantees about
their correctness, completeness or update cadence until they're properly rolled
out. They're here, so you may as well use them! :)
